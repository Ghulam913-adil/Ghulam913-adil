### 🌟 Git Commands Cheat Sheet

#### 🔧 Configuration
- **Set user name and email:**
  ```bash
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"
  git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
  ```
  This command sets your username and email address for Git. This information will be used for your commits.

#### 📂 Repository Management
- **Initialize a new repository:**
  ```bash
  git init
  ```
  This command creates an empty Git repository or reinitializes an existing one.

- **Clone an existing repository:**
  ```bash
  git clone <repository_url>
  ```
  This command clones a repository into a new directory.

#### 📋 Basic Commands
- **Check status:**
  ```bash
  git status
  ```
  This command shows the working tree status, including changes that have been staged, changes that haven't been staged, and untracked files.

- **Add files to the staging area:**
  ```bash
  git add <file>
  git add .
  ```
  This command adds file contents to the staging area. The first command stages a specific file, while the second command stages all changes in the current directory.

- **Commit changes:**
  ```bash
  git commit -m "Commit message"
  ```
  This command records changes to the repository with a descriptive message.

#### 🌿 Branching and Merging
- **Create a new branch:**
  ```bash
  git branch <branch_name>
  ```
  This command creates a new branch but does not switch to it.

- **Switch to a branch:**
  ```bash
  git checkout <branch_name>
  ```
  This command switches to the specified branch.

- **Create and switch to a new branch:**
  ```bash
  git checkout -b <branch_name>
  ```
  This command creates a new branch and switches to it.

- **Merge a branch into the current branch:**
  ```bash
  git merge <branch_name>
  ```
  This command merges the specified branch into the current branch.

#### 🌐 Remote Repositories
- **Add a remote repository:**
  ```bash
  git remote add origin <repository_url>
  ```
  This command adds a remote repository and names it 'origin'.

- **Push changes to remote repository:**
  ```bash
  git push origin <branch_name>
  ```
  This command pushes your changes to the specified branch on the remote repository.

- **Pull changes from remote repository:**
  ```bash
  git pull origin <branch_name>
  ```
  This command fetches and integrates changes from the specified branch of the remote repository into the current branch.

#### 🚀 Advanced Commands
- **Rebase:**
  ```bash
  git rebase <branch_name>
  ```
  This command applies your changes on top of another branch, effectively rewriting the commit history.

- **Stash changes:**
  ```bash
  git stash
  ```
  This command temporarily shelves (or stashes) changes you've made to your working directory, allowing you to work on something else and then come back and reapply them later.

- **Apply stashed changes:**
  ```bash
  git stash apply
  ```
  This command applies the stashed changes to your working directory.
